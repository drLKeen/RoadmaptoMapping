# Getting Started

Choose one of the worksheets from below to get started. It is strongly suggested to do the worksheets in order, as each worksheet relies on files created or loaded in previous worksheets.


```matlab
addpath("Data\","Solutions\","Worksheets\")
```
# Worksheets

Choose the workshop materials that you want to complete based on the time you have available. Worksheet 1 provides an overview of essential plotting functionality and map custimizaiton and is usually a good place to start. The other worksheets delve deeper into different MATLAB mapping functionality.
